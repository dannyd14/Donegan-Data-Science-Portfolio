## Donegan_Data_Science_Portfolio
I am currently a Junior at the University of Notre Dame studying Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics, hoping to further developing my programming and data analysis skills, while also gaining further practice in solving data problems. 

This page works to showcase the projects that I have completed, while also displaying my data science skills, specificially in regards to predictive modeling, data visualization, as well as other types of data science projects.

## Projects

## Streamlit App

** Description: ** Through this project, I took advantage of both python and streamlit libraries in order to create a simple app, that would allow users to explore and filter through data. This app features charts and graphs that allow users to better understand the data they are viewing, and thus learn more about the dataset. Through this project, I was able to showcase my ability to create an application that makes a data-script much more user-friendly, and also applicable for questions that users may have about the data.

** Skills: ** Python, Sreamlit, Pandas, | Data Visualization
