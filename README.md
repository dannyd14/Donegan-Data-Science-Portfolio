## Donegan_Data_Science_Portfolio
I am currently a Junior at the University of Notre Dame studying Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics, hoping to further developing my programming and data analysis skills, while also gaining further practice in solving data problems. 

This page works to showcase the projects that I have completed, while also displaying my data science skills, specificially in regards to predictive modeling, data visualization, as well as other types of data science projects.

## Projects

## Streamlit App

**Description:** Through this project, I took advantage of both python and streamlit libraries in order to create a simple app, that would allow users to explore and filter through data. This app features charts and graphs that allow users to better understand the data they are viewing, and thus learn more about the dataset. Through this project, I was able to showcase my ability to create an application that makes a data-script much more user-friendly, and also applicable for questions that users may have about the data.

**Skills:** Python, Sreamlit, Pandas, | Data Visualization


**Preview:** Using the Palmer's Penguins dataset, the user is able to interact with the data, using sliding scales and drop down filters to sort through data and learn more about the penguins included in the dataset. Here is an example:

## Tidy Data Project

**Description:** The Tidy Data project focuses on the importance of cleaning and organizing data so that one can effectively evaluate, model, and visualize data. Through this project, I took a data set that was previously messy and attained the three features of a tidy dataset. The three key features of tidyness are that each observation has its own row, each variable has its own column, and each observational set forms a table. Using the pandas library as well as other cleaning techniques, I was able to obtain a clean dataset, and then create visualizations from this clean data.

**Skills:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn | Data Visualization

**Preview:** Using a dataset based on Federal Research and Development spending by department from 1976 to 2019, after cleaning the dataset I was able to examine trends in these departments over 4 decades. Here is an example of a visualization that I created after obtaining a tidy dataset.
