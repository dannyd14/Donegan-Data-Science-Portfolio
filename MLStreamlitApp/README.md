## Machine Learning Streamlit Exploratory Application
This project will be an example of how to create an exploratory Machine Learning app using streamlit and its capabilities. While navigating this application, a user will be able to explore how different machine learning models operate and perform, either on their own data or with provided sample data.

## Project Overview
After choosing to either import their own data or use sample data, within this application, the user has the ability to choose a variety of machine learning models and train these models on the data. The user can choose which type of model they are looking to develop, either regression or classification. Next, the user is presented with the option to adjust the relevant hyperparamters for each type of machine learning model. At this point, they would train the models, and then are able to view the results of how the model performed at its intended task. The goal of this application is to allow a user to learn more about different types of machine learning models, and also explore how adjusting the hyperparamters of these models can change their performance.
