## Basic Streamlit App
This is a basic streamlit app that works to allow a user to learn more about different penguin species by filtering the data based on a few different factors. Users can examine information about the penguins filtering on the island in which they live, what type of species they are, and also their body mass.

## Project Overview
This project is a very basic application taking advantage of the streamlit libraries that allowed me to practice coding in python and also learn more about the interface and features that are avaliable through streamlit. For this project, I applied a basic penguins dataset, and this application allows the user to learn about this dataset, filtering by species, location, and body mass. This project is incredibly basic, but allowed me to practice using streamlit and laid the groundwork for future projects.


## App Features
As was mentioned before, this application is fairly simple, but allows for users to learn more about the applied penguins dataset. Within this application, the user can use either a categorical filter, or a sliding scale to adjust which observations are displayed, and thus can learn about the where the penguin is from, the different types of penguins, and also about their body mass.



## Instructions for App Usage -
To use this app, one should run the code using the streamlit run function, followed by the relative path of the file (i.e streamlit run basic-streamlit-app/main.py). While using the app, you can use the tab filters to choose the species and island variables, and the slider filter to show certain ranges of body masses.
